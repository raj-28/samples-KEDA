# Redis Streams Autoscaling with KEDA

This sample demonstrates autoscaling based on Redis Streams using KEDA.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Redis Streams**: Uses Redis 5.0+ streams feature
- **Consumer Groups**: Shows proper consumer group usage  
- **KEDA Scaling**: Scales based on pending entries in stream
- **Scale to Zero**: Demonstrates KEDA's scale-to-zero capability

## Architecture

**Note**: No separate docs PR required - this contribution is to the samples repository which hosts its own documentation within the sample README. The comprehensive documentation included in this sample serves as the required documentation update.
